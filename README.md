# Video and Image Generation through LLMs
##  Project Introduction

This system takes a clear image or video and converts it into various weather scenes—like **rainy**, **foggy**, or **snowy**—using prompt-conditioned and sketch-based control mechanisms.

## 🌐 Overview

The project explores **weather-aware image and video generation** using:
- Text-guided scene transformation (via LLMs)
- Sketch, edge, or mask conditioning (via ControlNet)
- Fast and lightweight inference (via SDXL-Lightning)

Given an input image or video, the model produces its transformed version in a different **weather condition** (e.g., rain, fog, snow), keeping the **scene structure consistent**.
